# Awesome CV [![Example](https://img.shields.io/badge/example-pdf-green.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV/master/examples/resume.pdf)


[**Awesome CV**](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) is LaTeX template for a **CV(Curriculum Vitae)**, **Résumé** or **Cover Letter** inspired by [Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/cv-or-resume/fancy-cv). It is easy to customize your own template, especially since it is really written by a clean, semantic markup.

It may be found in https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV. I have modified the format for my own needs. This repository is meant to help me keep my resume up to date and enable me to easily modify it on new computers.

To use, 
* Install Latex (xelatex specifically) -e.g., via `apt-get install texlive-full`
* Clone the repo -e.g., via `git clone https://github.com/lmoux/Awesome-CV.git`
* Modify corresponding files -e.g., data/experiences.tex
* Generate new PDF version -via `make`
