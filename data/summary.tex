\begin{cvparagraph}

%---------------------------------------------------------
	I bring more than a decade of experience in software development with exposure to various industries. I have performed much data analysis in academic research labs (at UPRM, UW-Madison, and Princeton), a Silicon Valley multinational and at a trading firm. I have stepped up to the plate when a firm needed revenue by profitably trading quantitative strategies. I have consistently exceeded expectations as evidenced by a steady stream of bonuses \& raises and I can directly trace my results to revenue in the millions.
